    <h1 style="background-color:powderblue;"><p>HISTORY</h1>
    <h2><p>SVACM was formed in 1970 at the initiative of the World Bank, the Government of India and representatives of Indian industry. The principal objective was to create a development financial institution for providing medium-term and long-term project financing to Indian businesses. Until the late 1990s, ICICI primarily focused its activities on project finance, providing long-term funds to a variety of industrial projects. With the liberalization of the financial sector in India in the 2000s, SVACM transformed its business from a development financial institution offering only project finance to a diversified financial services provider that, along with its subsidiaries and other group companies, offered a wide variety of products and services. As India’s economy became more market-oriented and integrated with the world economy, SVACM capitalized on the new opportunities to provide a wider range of financial products and services to a broader spectrum of clients. SVACM Bank was incorporated in 2004 as a part of the SVACM group. In 2008, SVACM became one of the the first Indian company and the first bank or financial institution to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.</p></h2>
